## Fathom Watch Faces

Fathom Watch Faces is a repository of experimental watch faces for the new Android Wear Watches, commissioned by Google Android Experiments. 


[Coubertin Rings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.fathom.watchfaces.coubertin&hl=en) uses the built-in sensors on your watch to display playful interactive rings that represent your daily step count. The more steps you take, the more rings you earn. As you hit step milestones throughout the day, the rings get bigger, change color, and scale up to quantify higher step counts (e.g. 10 steps, 100 steps, 1,000 steps). Once you hit the higher step counts, your watch will reward you with a splash of color to help motivate you to the next ring. Shoot for 10,000 steps and achieve a jubilation of color!

Paying homage to Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Olympic Games, the watch references the rings of the Olympic logo which was designed in 1912 by Coubertin himself. The Olympics are a symbol of goals and achievements, the *Coubertin Rings* watch face is meant to promote your daily activity performance.


[Bouncing Isaac](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.fathom.watchfaces.isaac&hl=en) uses the built-in sensors on your watch to display playful, interactive, geometric patterns and colors that change throughout the day. The more you move your watch, the more the color patterns and forms emerge. The background color changes every hour throughout the day, and the triangles are based on a sliding spectrum of highly saturated colors. The colors overlap one another as the leading point of the triangle hits one of the walls of your watch face.

The watch design pays tribute to Isaac Newton’s laws of motion and his experiments using a prism to refract white light to create a spectrum of color. *Bouncing Isaac* is a simple watch face that showcases the wonder of light and physics.


[Gaze Effect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.fathom.watchfaces.gaze&hl=en) displays mysterious eyes that gaze back at you when you look at your watch The more you look at your watch, the more your watch looks at you. If you don’t check your watch for a while, the eyes start disappearing. In the later hours of the day, the eyes grow tired, and they move and blink less. Keep an eye out for special times throughout the day when they get especially eerie.

The design alludes to Jacques Lacan’s psychological term “Gaze,” or the realization that you are an object being looked at just as an inanimate object can be looked at. The *Gaze Effect* watch face is a quirky reference to self-awareness, and our relationship to personal devices and time.
